WOL (Wake-On-LAN)
Copyright 2012 Mario Campos

WOL is a command-line program for executing the Wake-On-LAN protocol over
an ethernet local-area network. It requires a MAC address as an argument.

It then proceeds to broadcast an ethernet frame over the LAN encapsulating
a WOL "Magic Packet" for the intended hibernating computer.

Example: ./wol 00:11:22:33:44:55

NOTE: For WOL to work, the intended hibernating target must support and
be configured to listen for Wake-On-LAN packets via its BIOS, NIC or 
what have you.
